# `catalog-cd` actions

This folder holds several actions that are using `catalog-cd` to be used in GitHub workflows.

## `pull-from`

Pull, validate and (optionally) create a pull-request from a set of parameters (id, link, â€¦)

## `generate-pull-from-matrix`

Generates a GitHub Worklow outputs that can then be consumed with `strategy.matrix` from an `externals.yaml` file.

## Other possible ideas

- `release` to quickly and easily release a task or set of tasks using `catalog-cd`.
